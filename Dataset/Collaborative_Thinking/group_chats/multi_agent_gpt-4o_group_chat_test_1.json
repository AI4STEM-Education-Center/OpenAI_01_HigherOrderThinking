We know that the hydrogen atom consists of a single electron and a single proton, and its energy levels are quantized. The energy levels can be described by the Bohr model of the atom. \n\nConsidering that, what do you all think about the formula we would use to calculate the energy difference between these states?

Specifically, we use the formula \\( E_n = -13.6 \\frac{Z^2}{n^2} \\) eV, where \\(Z\\) is the atomic number (which is 1 for hydrogen) and \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor the ground state (\\(n = 1\\)), the energy is:\n\\[ E_1 = -13.6 \\frac{1^2}{1^2} = -13.6 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nFor the first excited state (\\(n = 2\\)), the energy is:\n\\[ E_2 = -13.6 \\frac{1^2}{2^2} = -3.4 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nThe energy required to excite the electron is the difference between these two states:\n\\[ \\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = -3.4 \\text{ eV} - (-13.6 \\text{ eV}) = 10.2 \\text{ eV} \\]\n\nAlejandro, do you want to add any further details or perhaps discuss the significance of these energy levels in hydrogen atom spectroscopy?"

The energy required to excite an electron in a hydrogen atom from the ground state (\\(n = 1\\)) to the first excited state (\\(n = 2\\)) is indeed 10.2 eV. This precise energy corresponds to a photon of ultraviolet light, which is part of the hydrogen atom's emission spectrum.\n\nUnderstanding these specific energy transitions is fundamental in spectroscopy, as each element has a unique spectral fingerprint due to its energy levels. This allows scientists to identify the presence of hydrogen in various cosmic or laboratory environments through its spectral lines.\n\nRobert, do you think we should delve deeper into the practical applications of this energy transition, perhaps in astrophysics or quantum mechanics?"
