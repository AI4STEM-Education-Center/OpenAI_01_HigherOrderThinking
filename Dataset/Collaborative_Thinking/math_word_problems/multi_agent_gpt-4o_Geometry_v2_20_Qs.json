Calculate the side length of the smaller hexagon in terms of the side length of the larger hexagon.\n2. Determine the area ratio by squaring the side length ratio (since the areas of similar figures are proportional to the squares of corresponding lengths).\n3. Express the ratio in simplest form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) and compute \\( m + n \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. We begin by using properties of regular hexagons. Each side of the smaller hexagon can be derived from the midpoint connection properties.\n2. Note that if we connect the midpoints of any two adjacent sides of the larger hexagon, the resulting segment is parallel to one of the sides of the larger hexagon and is half the length of one of its sides.\n3. Since the smaller hexagon is regular and created by these midpoints, each side of the smaller hexagon is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) times the side length of the larger hexagon.\n4. The ratio of the areas will thus be the square of the ratio of the side lengths.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\n# Let the side length of the larger hexagon be 1 for simplicity.\nside_length_ratio = Rational(1, 2)  # Smaller hexagon side length to larger hexagon side length\narea_ratio = side_length_ratio**2   # Areas are proportional to the square of corresponding lengths\n\n# Simplify the fraction and express it as m/n where m and n are relatively prime\narea_ratio_simplified = area_ratio.simplify()\nm, n = area_ratio_simplified.as_numer_denom()\n\n# Calculate m + n\nresult = m + n\n\nprint(f\"The ratio of the area of the smaller hexagon to the area of the larger hexagon is {area_ratio}. Therefore, m+n is: \\\\boxed{{{result}}}\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the ratio of the areas and prints the required \\(m + n\\) value in the boxed format. The answer will be automatically simplified by the `sympy` library. \nPlease run the code and provide the output.",

We'll follow Case 3 due to the mix of reasoning and calculation needed. We'll first derive the region that the midpoints of the line segments enclose and then calculate the area of that region. The solution will involve the following steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Line Segments**: Identify the coordinates of the endpoints of line segments within set \\( S \\).\n2. **Finding the Midpoints**: Calculate the midpoints of these line segments geometrically.\n3. **Enclosing the Region**: Determine the shape formed by these midpoints.\n4. **Area Calculation**: Calculate the area of the geometric shape formed by these midpoints using Python.\n\nLet's go through the process one step at a time.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Line Segments\n\nFor the square \\(ABCD\\) where \\(A = (0,0)\\), \\(B = (2,0)\\), \\(C = (2,2)\\), \\(D = (0,2)\\):\n- Each side has length 2, and segments of length 2 whose endpoints lie on adjacent sides are forming right-angled triangles.\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Midpoints\n\nWe need to find the midpoints of these line segments. This is straightforward since the midpoint of a line segment between points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Enclosing the Region\n\nBy plotting and connecting midpoints, we can find a geometric shape and calculate its area.\n\n### Step 4: Area Calculation\n\nFrom the plot, we can determine the vertices of the enclosed area and use a suitable method to find the area of the polygon.\n\nNow, let's use Python to perform these calculations and find \\( k \\):\n\n```python\n# filename: square_midpoints_area.py\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the square vertices\nA = (0, 0)\nB = (2, 0)\nC = (2, 2)\nD = (0, 2)\n\n# Function to calculate the midpoint\ndef midpoint(P, Q):\n    return ((P[0] + Q[0]) / 2, (P[1] + Q[1]) / 2)\n\n# Possible line segment midpoints\nmidpoints = [\n    midpoint(A, B),\n    midpoint(B, C),\n    midpoint(C, D),\n    midpoint(D, A),\n    midpoint(A, C),\n    midpoint(B, D)\n]\n\n# Manually determine midpoints for those segments\n# (2+0)/2 = 1, (2+0)/2 = 1 => (1,1)\n\n# Midpoints of relevant line segments\nmidpoints = [\n    (1,0), # Midpoint of segment from (0,0) to (2,0)\n    (2,1), # Midpoint of segment from (2,0) to (2,2)\n    (1,2), # Midpoint of segment from (2,2) to (0,2)\n    (0,1)  # Midpoint of segment from (0,2) to (0,0)\n]\n\n# These midpoints form a smaller square centered in the original square\n# Square vertices: (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1)\npolygon = sp.Polygon(\n    sp.Point(1, 0), \n    sp.Point(2, 1), \n    sp.Point(1, 2), \n    sp.Point(0, 1)\n)\n\n# Calculate the area of the polygon\narea = polygon.area\n\n# Area rounded to the nearest hundredth and then find k = 100 * area\nk = sp.nsimplify(100 * area)\nprint(k)\n```\n\nPlease run the provided code to find `k`, and let me know the output!",

Count and print the number of valid triangles.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# filename: isosceles_triangles.py\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n\n# Given sides\nsides = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n\ndef is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):\n    # Check if the given sides form a valid triangle\n    return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a\n\ndef count_isosceles_triangles(sides):\n    count = 0\n    # Generate combinations with replacement for isosceles triangles (two equal sides)\n    for side in sides:\n        for unique_side in sides:\n            if unique_side == side:\n                continue\n            if is_valid_triangle(side, side, unique_side):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Calculate and print the result\nresult = count_isosceles_triangles(sides)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nRun the code and obtain the count of different isosceles triangles.
